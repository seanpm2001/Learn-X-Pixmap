// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-X-PixMap
// About:
// I decided to make X-PixMap the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-X-PixMap) as X-PixMap is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the X-PixMap programming language. It only makes sense to X-PixMap the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
